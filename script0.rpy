    mc "Hmm... huuh... hm?"

    mc "Wha... where am I?"

    "Then the realization hit me"

    "I was right back in hell: math class."

    "Someone was whispering something to me"

    a "Psst, heyyy, wake UP!"

    teach "Ah, [player]. It looks like you've finally decided to join us. Would you be so kind as to answer the question on the board, please?"

    "ahh man... I fell asleep again."

    "It's only been a week since summer break ended and this is already the second time it's happened..."

    "I quickly wipe my blurry eyes and focus on the board."

    mc "Y-yes, sorry about that. Let me just uh..."

    "I squint my eyes."

    "..."

    "....."

    "Okay."
    
    "I have no idea what the answer is."

    "I stared in silence for what felt like an eternity."

    "That's when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye."

    "The girl next to me was trying to get my attention."

    "Was it her that woke me up a second ago?"

    "I subtly glanced over at her."

    "She was holding up 8 fingers below her desk."

    "With the only other alternative being a meek 'I don't know,' I decided to run with it."

    mc "Uh-ummm... I think in this case, X would equal 8."

    "The uncertainty in my voice was obvious."

    teach "Good guess. Moving on. Now we're going to work an example equation in which there are two a variables---"

    "That was a lucky break. Looks like he didn't notice."

    teach "And [player]? No more lifelines if I call on you again."

    "Never mind."

    "Man this crap is so embarrassing. I really need to find a better way of staying awake."

    "Not that I can help it sometimes."

    "I rub my eyes again and try to stay focused for the rest of the class."

    "Finally, the school day's over. Having math as my final class is brutal."

    "I turn to the girl sitting next to me."

    mc "Thanks for the save earlier."

    "She looks at me with a cheeky smile."

    a "No problem man, I've got you covered."

    show anna concern 

    a "But uh... the same thing happened last week, too didn't it? Everything alright?"

    mc "Ahaha... I guess it did, huh? But yeah, I'm okay... more or less."

    "I can't help but notice that everyone is now staring at me."

    "Some are annoyingly smiling with assuming expressions."

    "I awkwardly call back."

    mc "Y-yeah! See you then!"

    "I keep my head down and hurry past all of the onlookers as they snicker to themselves."

    "I come up to the employee entrance and take a minute to compose myself."

    "It's not like it's uncommon that I have to run here to make in in time, but I like to at least look somewhat presentable."

    "After taking a few deep breaths and adjusting my clothes, I head inside."

    m "We're loaded today."

    mc "On a Tuesday."

    m "I know!"

    mc "So what's going on?"

    show mayu glance

    m "Well- actually, I do"

    m "The boss is hosting some private event today for some company."

    m "Apparently the whole place is booked from 3 to 10 tonight and everyone here has a company holiday tomorrow."

    mc "Wow. And where's the boss now?"

    m "Out getting more drinks."

    show mayu normal

    m "He'll be back later, so it's just us right now."

    mc "Got it, I'll be ready in 2 minutes."

    show mayu bigsmile

    m "Great, thanks!"

    "I hurry to the back room and put my bag down."

    "The boss got us some small lockers to leave our uniforms in so I thankfully don't have to keep it in my school bag all the time."

    "My school's uniform already has black pants, so all I need to do is throw on the button-up shirt, vest, and skinny tie."

    "I hear Mayu frantically preparing drinks out in the main room."

    mc "I'd better hurry."

    "As I finish tightening my tie, I head back out."

    m "[player]! You all set to go?"

    mc "Yep!"

    m "Alright you're on table duty today."

    m "I'll be able to help you out when the boss gets back, but for now I've got to focus on this crazy list of orders."

    "Guess I'm going to be making a lot of new friends tonight..."

    mc "Got it, no problem."

    "I've worked here long enough that I'm pretty used to interacting with customers, but I've never been able to get used to dealing with this many people at once."

    "It looks like every table is seating at least 4 or 5 people."

    "But it's my job and I'm getting paid for it, so no use thinking about it too much."

    "I walk over to the first table I see with no drinks on it."

    "Everyone there is laughing and talking loudly."

    "I mentally prepared myself as I got ready to say my standard opening line."

    mc "Hello everyone, welcome to 'The Tumultuous Tap,' my name is [player], what can I get for you?"

    "I still haven't gotten over the name of this place. Who in the world decides to put 'Tumultuous' in the name of their establishment?"

    "It only takes me 3 seconds of imagining the boss."

    "Yeah, he definitely would."

    "And the bar is always busy, so he must know what he's doing to some degree..."

    "I realize I'm about get lost in thought, so I focus back on the table in front of me."

    man1 "Yeah uh... I'll take a margarita and a lemon sour."

    man2 "You're gonna start with 2 drinks already?"

    man1 "Come on Tom don't start grillin me right off the bat."

    man2 "Your call man, but we all know how you get."

    man1 "Oh lay off I'm not that bad. Right, fellas?"

    "The other men give him a skeptical look."

    man1 "Really? Even you, Cam?"
    
    man3 "Look dude I would've been with you before last Friday. But after seeing you pull down-"
    
    man1 "Ok! Ok! You made your point! No need to bring that up again."

    "He turns back to me."
    
    man1 "Sorry, I'll just take one for now."

    mc "Which one would you like?"

    man1 "Actually, come back around to me I'm not sure yet."

    mc "Alright."

    "I look to the man next to him."

    man2 "Whiskey sour on the rocks."

    "I quickly scribble the name down on my notepad and look up at the next man."

    man3 "A big Beer."

    "And the next."

    man4 "Beer for me, too."

    "The men look back to the first man whose name I still don't know."

    man4 "You decided yet, Jay?"

    man1 "Yeah just give me the lemon sour to start."

    "I finish writing everything down on my notepad"

    mc "Understood! I'll have those out for you soon."

    "But by the time I look back up none of them are paying attention to me anymore."

    "They're all looking in the same direction."

    "Right at Mayu."

    "..."

    "Well no surprise there. This kind of thing happens all the time."

    "And I already know what's coming as soon as I bring the drinks back."

    "I decide to ignore it for the time being and head over to Mayu."

    "I tear off the top page of the notepad and hand it to her."

    mc "Here's the order for table 12."

    m "Great, thanks, I'll have these ready in just a minute."
